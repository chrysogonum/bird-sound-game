 We Can Resume Later Without Confusion

  I've created docs/add_birds_checkpoint.md with:

  ✅ What we accomplished:
  - Enhanced /add-bird workflow
  - 18 species design prompts
  - 180 ML catalog numbers selected
  - Cornell access request ready to submit

  ✅ Next steps (when Cornell responds):
  - Step-by-step workflow from download → deploy
  - Alternative Xeno-Canto path if needed
  - All commands and file locations documented

  ✅ Current state:
  - Clean working directory
  - All commits pushed
  - Files ready in ~/Downloads/

  ---
  When You Want to Resume:

  1. Open docs/add_birds_checkpoint.md
  2. Check Cornell email/ticket status
  3. Follow the appropriate path (approved/denied/still waiting)
