# SoundField: Birds

A rhythm-game–style training app that teaches players to identify bird sounds in real time. Think **Guitar Hero for birding**.

## What Is This?

Players identify:
- **Which bird** (species via radial wheel)
- **Which ear** (left/right channel)
- **At the right moment** (timing accuracy)

**Core Principle:** Audio-first, visual-augmented. Audio is always primary; spectrograms are optional scaffolding that fade as skill improves.

## Demo

```
Bird call plays in LEFT ear
→ Player taps LEFT side of screen
→ Player selects "Carolina Wren" on wheel
→ +100 points (species + channel + timing correct)
```

## Features

- **4 Game Modes:** Campaign, Practice, Challenge, Random Soundfield
- **Sound Packs:** Curated species groups (Common SE Birds, Spring Warblers, Sparrows, Woodpeckers)
- **Progressive Difficulty:** Event density, overlap, timing windows, spectrogram visibility
- **Real Audio:** Sourced from Xeno-canto, normalized and tagged
- **Confusion Analytics:** Learn which species you mix up

## Current Species (v1)

Southeastern U.S. focus:
- Northern Cardinal (NOCA)
- Carolina Wren (CARW)
- Blue Jay (BLJA)
- American Crow (AMCR)
- Tufted Titmouse (TUTI)
- *...expanding to 30-50 species*

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Game Code | TypeScript |
| Audio Engine | Web Audio API |
| Asset Pipelines | Python |
| Testing | Vitest |
| Build | Make |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
make install

# Run tests
make test

# Start dev server
make dev
```

## Development

This project uses phased development with Make targets:

```bash
make phase-a    # Audio ingestion
make phase-b    # Playback engine
make phase-c    # Input & scoring
make phase-d    # Level system
make phase-e    # UX polish
make phase-f    # Game modes
# ... phases G-N for packs, spectrograms, analytics
```

Validate any phase:
```bash
make smoke-b    # Run Phase B tests
make ralph PHASE=c  # Build + test Phase C
```
