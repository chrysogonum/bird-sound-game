SUBJECT: Educational Media Request - ChipNotes! Bird Sound Training App

AFFILIATION: Independent developer / Open-source educational project

MEDIA USAGE DESCRIPTION:

I am developing ChipNotes!, a free, open-source web application that teaches people to identify bird species by sound. The app uses game-like mechanics to help users develop aural identification skills through interactive training with immediate feedback.

Project Details:
- Name: ChipNotes! (https://chrysogonum.github.io/bird-sound-game/)
- Purpose: Educational, non-commercial bird sound identification training
- License: Open source (MIT)
- Audience: Birdwatchers, students, naturalists, and educators
- Current Status: Launched January 8, 2026 (8 days ago) with 87 species from Xeno-Canto
- Development: 129 commits, full game engine, production-ready PWA

Request:
I am requesting access to high-quality audio recordings for 18 Eastern US bird species to expand the educational content. I would greatly appreciate:

1. BULK DOWNLOAD: 180 carefully selected recordings (10 per species)
   - Complete list of ML catalog numbers attached as CSV
   - Selected using quality score formula: rating × √(num_ratings + 1)
   - Average rating: 4.32/5.00
   - Vocalization diversity: Songs, calls, dawn songs, flight calls
   - Seasonal coverage across multiple years

2. API ACCESS (for future projects): Programmatic download capability for educational developers
   - Would facilitate upcoming warbler audit (30+ species)
   - Enables systematic quality control and metadata management
   - Maintains Cornell attribution requirements programmatically
   - Non-commercial, educational use only

Species List (18 total):
Great Crested Flycatcher (GCFL), Eastern Phoebe (EAPH), Eastern Wood-Pewee (EWPE), Acadian Flycatcher (ACFL), White-eyed Vireo (WEVI), Red-eyed Vireo (REVI), Northern House Wren (NHWR), Blue-gray Gnatcatcher (BGGN), Swainson's Thrush (SWTH), Veery (VEER), Summer Tanager (SUTA), Scarlet Tanager (SCTA), Purple Finch (PUFI), Rose-breasted Grosbeak (RBGR), Dark-eyed Junco (DEJU), Brown-headed Cowbird (BHCO), European Starling (EUST), Chimney Swift (CHSW)

Attribution:
All Macaulay Library media will be properly credited with:
- ML catalog numbers displayed with each clip
- Full recordist names and dates
- Direct links to ML specimen pages
- Comprehensive credits page listing all contributors

Educational Potential:
ChipNotes! aims to support Cornell Lab's mission by:
- Helping birders develop skills for eBird contributions
- Providing free, accessible birding education
- Using expert-curated recordings from ML archive
- Supporting citizen science and conservation

Why request Cornell media at launch?
I'm prioritizing content quality and proper attribution from day one, rather than building a user base first. Cornell's curated recordings would establish credibility and scientific accuracy for this new educational tool from its inception.

Technical Specifications:
- Audio processing: Mono WAV, 44.1kHz, -16 LUFS normalization
- Duration: Trimmed to 0.5-3.0 seconds for training purposes
- No pitch/speed changes (only trimming/normalization)
- ML catalog numbers stored for full traceability

Commitment:
- Educational, non-commercial use only
- Proper attribution following Cornell guidelines
- Reasonable rate limits if API access granted
- Open source code benefits educational community

Thank you for considering this educational media request. I'm happy to provide additional information, discuss licensing terms, or adjust the request scope as needed.
