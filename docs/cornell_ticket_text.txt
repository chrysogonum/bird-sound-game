SUBJECT: Educational Media Request - ChipNotes! Bird Sound Training App

AFFILIATION: Independent developer / Open-source educational project

MEDIA USAGE DESCRIPTION:

I'm developing ChipNotes! (https://chrysogonum.github.io/bird-sound-game/), a free, open-source web application for bird sound identification training. Launched January 8, 2026, the app uses game mechanics to teach aural ID skills with immediate feedback.

PROJECT STATUS:
- Production-ready PWA with 87 species (currently Xeno-Canto source)
- Open source (MIT license), non-commercial, educational purpose
- 129 commits, comprehensive test coverage (522 tests)
- Full attribution infrastructure from day one

REQUEST:
1. BULK DOWNLOAD: 180 recordings for 18 Eastern US species (10 per species)
   - ML catalog numbers attached as CSV
   - Systematically selected: avg rating 4.32/5.00
   - Vocalization diversity: songs, calls, dawn songs, flight calls

2. API ACCESS: Programmatic download for future educational projects
   - Upcoming warbler audit (30+ species)
   - Non-commercial educational use only

SPECIES (18): GCFL, EAPH, EWPE, ACFL, WEVI, REVI, NHWR, BGGN, SWTH, VEER, SUTA, SCTA, PUFI, RBGR, DEJU, BHCO, EUST, CHSW

ATTRIBUTION:
All ML media will display:
- ML catalog numbers with each clip
- Recordist names, dates, locations
- Direct links to ML specimen pages

RATIONALE:
Prioritizing content quality and scientific accuracy from launch, rather than building user base first. Cornell's curated recordings would establish credibility for this new educational tool and support the Lab's mission of accessible birding education.

TECHNICAL:
- Processing: Mono WAV, 44.1kHz, -16 LUFS normalization
- Duration: 0.5-3.0 seconds (no pitch/speed changes)
- Traceability: ML catalog numbers stored in metadata
