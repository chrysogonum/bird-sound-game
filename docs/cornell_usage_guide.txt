CORNELL RECORDINGS - USAGE GUIDE
================================================================================

WHAT WAS DONE:
--------------
Processed 18 Cornell Macaulay Library CSV files containing 4,553 total 
recordings to select the best 10 recordings per species based on:
- Community ratings and number of raters
- Vocalization type diversity
- Seasonal and temporal coverage

RESULTS:
--------
✓ 180 recordings selected (10 per species)
✓ 18 species covered (all targets met)
✓ Average rating: 4.32/5.00
✓ 76 unique recordists
✓ Temporal range: 1963-2025

OUTPUT FILES:
-------------
1. cornell_selected_recordings.csv (16 KB)
   - Ready-to-use CSV with all selected recordings
   - ML catalog numbers for downloading audio
   - Ratings, vocalization types, dates, recordists

2. cornell_selection_summary.txt (7.6 KB)
   - Complete analysis and statistics
   - Quality metrics and diversity analysis
   - Species-by-species breakdown

3. cornell_usage_guide.txt (this file)
   - How to use the results

USING THE RESULTS:
------------------

Option 1: Download Individual Recordings
   Each ML catalog number can be downloaded from Cornell's Macaulay Library:
   
   https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/[ML_CATALOG_NUMBER]
   
   Example: ML347203291 → https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/347203291
   
   Note: You may need a Cornell account for bulk downloads.

Option 2: Bulk Download via Python
   Use the cornell_ingest.py script in this repository:
   
   python scripts/cornell_ingest.py \
       --input ~/Downloads/cornell_selected_recordings.csv \
       --output data/clips/

Option 3: Import to Audio Ingest Pipeline
   The CSV format matches the expected input for audio_ingest.py:
   
   - Species_Code: Maps to 4-letter codes (GCFL, EAPH, etc.)
   - ML_Catalog_Number: Unique identifier
   - Vocalization_Type: Behavior classification
   - Rating/Num_Raters: Quality metrics

SPECIES CODES MAPPING:
----------------------
GCFL = Great Crested Flycatcher (grcfly)
EAPH = Eastern Phoebe (easpho)
EWPE = Eastern Wood-Pewee (eawpew)
ACFL = Acadian Flycatcher (acafly)
WEVI = White-eyed Vireo (whevir)
REVI = Red-eyed Vireo (reevir1)
NHWR = Northern House Wren (houwre)
BGGN = Blue-gray Gnatcatcher (buggna)
SWTH = Swainson's Thrush (swathr)
VEER = Veery (veery)
SUTA = Summer Tanager (sumtan)
SCTA = Scarlet Tanager (scatan)
PUFI = Purple Finch (purfin)
RBGR = Rose-breasted Grosbeak (robgro)
DEJU = Dark-eyed Junco (daejun)
BHCO = Brown-headed Cowbird (bnhcow)
EUST = European Starling (eursta)
CHSW = Chimney Swift (chiswi)

QUALITY CONSIDERATIONS:
-----------------------
Top Quality Species (Score >15):
- CHSW (Chimney Swift): 24.19
- EUST (European Starling): 19.21
- BHCO (Brown-headed Cowbird): 18.64
- DEJU (Dark-eyed Junco): 16.57

May Need Review:
- PUFI (Purple Finch): Lower avg rating (3.28)
- SWTH (Swainson's Thrush): Fewer raters (1.6)

Note: All selections meet quality thresholds, but manual verification
of the "may need review" species is recommended.

VOCALIZATION DIVERSITY:
-----------------------
All species include:
✓ Song examples
✓ Call examples
✓ Multiple vocalization types (3-5 per species)

Best diversity (5 types):
- DEJU (Dark-eyed Junco)
- EAPH (Eastern Phoebe)  
- GCFL (Great Crested Flycatcher)

REGENERATING SELECTIONS:
------------------------
To adjust selection criteria or regenerate with different parameters:

1. Edit the script:
   /Users/peterrepetti/bird_sound_game/scripts/select_cornell_recordings.py

2. Modify these key parameters:
   - Quality threshold (line ~48)
   - Target recordings per species (line ~102)
   - Vocalization type priorities (line ~55-75)

3. Re-run:
   python scripts/select_cornell_recordings.py

NEXT ACTIONS:
-------------
1. Review the cornell_selected_recordings.csv file
2. Verify ML catalog numbers are accessible
3. Download recordings using preferred method
4. Import to audio processing pipeline
5. Validate audio quality (duration, format, noise level)
6. Generate spectrograms if needed
7. Update clips.json with new recordings
