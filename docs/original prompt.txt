"write me a game styled after things like dance, dance revolution and guitar hero, but for identifying bird sounds. We have to rely on publicly available sound recording data of Birds so that we can get the appropriate mix of both calls and songs. The idea is that the game could have several levels starting easy where bird sounds are infrequent and only coming from left or right audio channels at one time, but then moving to more difficult levels where there are multiple birds of different species coming at you from both ears. Audio playback is obviously very important. We also have to figure out a way for the user to quickly input which birds they are hearing. That may be one of the biggest challenges. The idea would be to correctly identify as many sounds from the correct birds at the right time and place ((left or right ear). The game should focus initially only on common birds in the southeastern USA so that will restrict the list of birds we need data for.""
