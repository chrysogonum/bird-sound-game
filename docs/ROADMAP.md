## Success Metrics

After completing Phases 1-5:
- **~150 NA species** (up from 106)
- **4 new packs:** Owls & Nightbirds, Thrushes & Mimics, Waterbirds & Wetlands, Flycatchers
- **Zero major category gaps** (owls, thrushes, nightjars, wrens all covered)
- **Balanced regional coverage** (Eastern and Western both comprehensive)

---

## Audio Sourcing Notes

For each new species, need:
- 3-5 high-quality clips per species minimum
- Mix of songs and calls where applicable
- Clips from Xeno-Canto (CC-licensed)
- Run through standard preprocessing pipeline (mono, 0.5-3s, -16 LUFS)
- Generate spectrograms
- Create/source icon

Use existing workflow:
```bash
python3 scripts/audio_ingest.py --species "Species Name" --max-per-species 5
python3 scripts/merge_candidates.py data/candidates_XXXX
python3 scripts/spectrogram_gen.py --input data/clips --output data/spectrograms
```
