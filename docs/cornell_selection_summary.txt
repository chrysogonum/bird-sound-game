CORNELL MACAULAY LIBRARY RECORDING SELECTION
Final Summary Report
================================================================================

TASK OVERVIEW:
Process 18 Cornell Macaulay Library CSV files to select the best 10 recordings

ALL SPECIES ACHIEVED 10 RECORDINGS - NO SHORTFALLS

================================================================================
TOP PERFORMERS (By Quality Score = Rating × Avg Raters)
================================================================================

1. CHSW (Chimney Swift)             - Score: 24.19
2. EUST (European Starling)         - Score: 19.21
3. BHCO (Brown-headed Cowbird)      - Score: 18.64
4. DEJU (Dark-eyed Junco)           - Score: 16.57

================================================================================
VOCALIZATION DIVERSITY CHAMPIONS
================================================================================

Most Diverse (5 vocalization types):
- DEJU: Dark-eyed Junco (song, call, chip note, flight call/song, unknown)
- EAPH: Eastern Phoebe (song, call, chip note, flight call/song, unknown)
- GCFL: Great Crested Flycatcher (song, call, dawn song, vocalization, unknown)

Best Identified (>70% non-unknown):
- CHSW: Chimney Swift (80% identified)
- SUTA: Summer Tanager (80% identified)
- DEJU: Dark-eyed Junco (70% identified)

================================================================================
SPECIES REQUIRING ATTENTION
================================================================================

Lower Quality Scores (May need manual review):
- PUFI (Purple Finch): Low avg rating (3.28), few raters (1.7)
- SWTH (Swainson's Thrush): Few raters (1.6)
- GCFL (Great Crested Flycatcher): Few raters (1.9)

High "Unknown" Vocalization Percentage:
- EWPE (Eastern Wood-Pewee): 70% unknown
- RBGR (Rose-breasted Grosbeak): 70% unknown
- GCFL (Great Crested Flycatcher): 60% unknown
- PUFI (Purple Finch): 60% unknown

Note: These species still have good quality recordings, but the behavior/
vocalization type information may be less specific in the metadata.

================================================================================

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS & RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. IMMEDIATE USE:
   - CSV is ready for ingestion into audio_ingest.py
   - All ML catalog numbers can be used to download recordings from
     Cornell's Macaulay Library

2. QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS:
   - Consider manual review of PUFI selections (lowest quality scores)
   - Review "unknown" vocalizations for EWPE, RBGR to add specificity
   - Verify GCFL and SWTH selections have sufficient diversity

3. METADATA ENHANCEMENT:
   - Cross-reference selections with spectrograms
   - Add behavioral context from recordist notes
   - Verify vocalization type classifications

4. EXPANSION OPTIONS:
   - If needed, fallback recordings available for all species
   - Can increase to 15-20 recordings per species if desired
   - Additional regional variants available (many species have >100 recordings)
