# SoundField: Birds - How to Play

Welcome to SoundField: Birds! Train your ears to recognize the songs and calls of local birds. Whether you're a curious beginner or an experienced birder looking to sharpen your skills, this game will help you build real-world bird identification abilities.

## The Basics

**Listen. Identify. Tap.**

Bird sounds will play through your left or right ear (or headphone). Your job is to identify which bird is singing and tap its circle before the tile passes through the scoring zone.

Each round lasts 30 seconds. Birds will call out one at a time, and you'll see a tile with a spectrogram (a visual "picture" of the sound) scrolling down the screen. Match the sound to the correct bird, and tap the circle on the correct side (left or right) to score points.

## Scoring

Your score depends on timing and accuracy:

| Result | Points | What happened |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Perfect** | 100 | Correct bird + correct ear + great timing |
| **Good** | 75 | Correct bird + correct ear |
| **Partial** | 25 | Correct bird, wrong ear |
| **Miss** | 0 | Wrong bird or no response |

**Streaks:** Consecutive correct answers build your streak, shown as dots in the center of the screen. Keep the streak going for bonus satisfaction!

## The Packs

### 5 Common Backyard Birds (Starter Pack)
*Perfect for beginners*

Meet five distinctive birds you're likely to hear in your own backyard:
- **NOCA** - Northern Cardinal
- **CARW** - Carolina Wren
- **TUTI** - Tufted Titmouse
- **BLJA** - Blue Jay
- **AMCR** - American Crow

These birds have bold, recognizable voices - a great foundation for building your ear.

### Expanded Local Birds
*For the growing birder*

Ready for more? This pack includes 27 species from the eastern United States, from the cheerful American Goldfinch to the drumming woodpeckers. Each round randomly selects 9 birds, so you'll encounter different combinations each time you play.

### Sparrows
*Master the subtle singers*

Sparrows are notoriously tricky - their songs can sound similar at first, but each species has distinctive patterns. This pack focuses on seven sparrow species:
- **WTSP** - White-throated Sparrow (the "Old Sam Peabody" song)
- **SOSP** - Song Sparrow (complex, musical phrases)
- **CHSP** - Chipping Sparrow (dry, mechanical trill)
- **SWSP** - Swamp Sparrow (slow, sweet trill)
- **SASP** - Savannah Sparrow (buzzy, insect-like song)
- **FISP** - Field Sparrow (accelerating bouncing ball)
- **LISP** - Lincoln's Sparrow (bubbly, wren-like song)

### Woodpeckers
*Drums, rattles, and calls*

Woodpeckers communicate with drums, calls, and rattles - very different from songbird melodies. Learn to distinguish seven species:
- **DOWO** - Downy Woodpecker (short, high "pik" call)
- **HAWO** - Hairy Woodpecker (sharper, louder "peek")
- **RBWO** - Red-bellied Woodpecker (rolling "churr")
- **PIWO** - Pileated Woodpecker (loud, laughing call)
- **YBSA** - Yellow-bellied Sapsucker (cat-like mewing)
- **NOFL** - Northern Flicker (loud "wick-wick-wick")
- **RHWO** - Red-headed Woodpecker (harsh "tchur" call)

## The Levels

Each pack has six levels that progressively challenge your listening skills:

### Level 1: Meet the Birds / Meet the Flock
*Get to know the sounds*

You'll hear only the "canonical" recording for each bird - the clearest, most typical example of their song. Sounds play in one ear only. This is your chance to learn each bird's signature voice.

### Level 2: Sound Variations
*Same bird, different recordings*

Birds don't sing the same way every time! Now you'll hear up to three different recordings per species. Learn to recognize the variations within each bird's repertoire.

### Level 3: Full Repertoire
*The complete songbook*

All available recordings are now in play. Some birds have many variations - can you recognize them all?

### Level 4: Both Ears
*Spatial listening*

Back to canonical recordings, but now sounds can come from either ear with a slight offset. You'll need to identify both the bird AND which side it's coming from.

### Level 5: Variations + Both Ears
*Putting it together*

Multiple recordings per bird, coming from either side. Your skills are really being tested now!

### Level 6: Master Birder
*The full challenge*

All recordings, both ears, full speed. You've trained your ear to recognize these birds like a seasoned field birder. Well done!

## Tips for Success

1. **Use headphones.** The left/right distinction is essential for scoring, and you'll hear the details better.

2. **Start with the Starter Pack.** Even if you're eager to try more birds, the five common backyard birds are a great foundation. Master them first.

3. **Listen for patterns.** Each bird has characteristic rhythms, pitches, and phrases. The Northern Cardinal's "cheer-cheer-cheer" is very different from the Carolina Wren's bubbling song.

4. **Use the Bird Reference.** On the Pack Select screen, you can preview each bird's sound. Listen before you play!

5. **Don't rush.** You have time to listen. Let the sound register before you tap.

6. **Learn from mistakes.** The round summary shows which birds gave you trouble. Focus on those in the Bird Reference section.

7. **Try spectrogram-only mode.** Once you've mastered the sounds, challenge yourself by playing with your device muted. Can you identify birds by their spectrograms alone?

## The Spectrograms

The colorful images on the tiles are spectrograms - visual representations of sound. Time moves left to right, pitch goes low to high (bottom to top), and brightness shows volume.

With practice, you'll start to recognize birds by their spectrogram patterns alone. That downward sweep? Probably a cardinal. Those horizontal bands? Could be a titmouse. The spectrogram is a clue, but trust your ears first!

## About the Sounds

All bird recordings come from the Xeno-Canto community library (xeno-canto.org), a wonderful resource of bird sounds from around the world. Each recording was selected for clarity and uploaded by dedicated birders and naturalists.

*Happy birding! The more you play, the more you'll notice these songs in the world around you. That's the real reward.*
